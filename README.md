It uses EmguCV and is written in c#.

1. create a folder called lib and place in extracted folder created when after extracting contents of repository
2. go to http://sourceforge.net/projects/emgucv/files/emgucv/ and download version 3.0.0 [the latest release at the time of writing this]
3. copy the contents of the bin folder into the lib folder created in step one [just the dll's and xml files, example exe's can be ignored]
